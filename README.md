# Arduino-Powered Portable Speaker

## Overview
This project is an **Arduino-powered portable speaker**, designed to be a **self-contained, battery-operated audio device**. The speaker utilizes the **DFPlayer Mini** module to play audio files directly from an **SD card**, with automatic track looping for continuous playback.

Powered by **6 AA batteries**, this speaker is easy to maintain and allows for quick battery replacement. 

Originally this speaker was conceived as a *fun project to attach to a Roomba*, to get the roomba to say *"OW"* on impact with furniture


## Concept & Inspiration
The idea for this portable speaker originated from collaborative discussions with **Jackson Bowles, Alex Anthony, and Brenden Mahoney**, exploring potential startup ventures. Through brainstorming and feedback, the design evolved into a compact, user-friendly device focused on convenience and functionality.


## Features
- Self-contained, battery-powered design  
- Audio playback directly from an SD card  
- Automatic track looping  
- Quick and simple battery replacement  
- Arduino-based control using the **DFPlayer Mini** module  
- Portable and adaptable to multiple use cases beyond the original concept
